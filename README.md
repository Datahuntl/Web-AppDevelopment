## Website

1. How to create your own website?
  - Website Builders

Good for people that don't know how to program, easy access and most of them are free, ability to set up e-commerce, so very friendly for small and/or local businesses, Wordpress and Weebly are examples of website builders.

  - CMS

A Content Management System (CMS), from what I've looked up, is very close to what a Website builder is, however they allow the user to code on it, creating custom features, apps such as Wix and Squarespace are examples of CMS.
  
  - Code from Scratch

What we're here to do, there are multiple frameworks for the Front-End and Back-End of a website, so choosing the right one for you is the first step.
