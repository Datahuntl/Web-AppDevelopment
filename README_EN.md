# Website Development (Mobile & Computer)

## Introduction

This repository has been created since when I've had the interest to code my own website, it will have all questions that I had, alongside everything that I used as reference to write this, hope this helps to anyone that comes by this!

## Website

1. How to create your own website?
  - Website Builders

Good for people that don't know how to program, easy access and most of them are free, ability to set up e-commerce, so very friendly for small and/or local businesses, Wordpress and Weebly are examples of website builders.

  - CMS

A Content Management System (CMS), from what I've looked up, is very close to what a Website builder is, however they allow the user to code on it, creating custom features, apps such as Wix and Squarespace are examples of CMS.
  
  - Code from Scratch

What we're here to do, there are multiple frameworks for the Front-End and Back-End of a website, so choosing the right one for you is the first step.

2. Which framework to choose?

Picking a framework, first comes with learning a language and being comfortable with it, as we learn everywhere, there is no best programming language, each language and framework will have its pro's and con's, so it's important to understand the what are the requirements of your project and the expertise of those working on it.

> Back-End:

  - JavaScript
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Java
  - C#
  - Go

> Front-End:

  - JavaScript
  - HTML
  - CSS

I've linked websites that explain advantages and disavantages of each language and which are mostly used in 2024, in this Repository, I will be working with Java on my back-end and Javascript on my front-end.
